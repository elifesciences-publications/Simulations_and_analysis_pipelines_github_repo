NOTE: this folder contains data from Vijayan et al. (2009), PNAS
GSE18902 microarray dataset from GEO (cited in main text).
The fits to average transcriptional profiles of dawn and dusk genes are 
generated by dawn_dusk_genes_mVals_github/analyzeMicroarray.m script.
There is already a stored copy of these fits in the file
2016-08-23_VijayanDawnDuskRawFit.mat in the dawn_dusk_genes_mVals_github
directory.
