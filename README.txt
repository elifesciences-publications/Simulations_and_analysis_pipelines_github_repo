******************************

This directory contains scripts and functions used to analyze data and perform simulations described in "The cyanobacterial circadian clock tracks midday in vivo and in vitro" by Leypunskiy et al.

Below is a map describing where you can find scripts for specific figures/analyses. Each directory contains a readme.txt file that describes how the files are organized and which files perform which analyses.

Note that a lot of the scripts rely on accessory files provided in dependencies_github/ folder. Please add those files to your MATLAB path before running any scripts.
